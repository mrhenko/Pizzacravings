		<h2>But how does it work? (Yes, I'm a geek.)</h2>
		<p>You want the more in depth explanation?</p>
		<p>Okay, here's how it's done. This is a JavaScript/HTML-based
		web app (buzzword warning) that uses the location API to find
		out where you are. This information is then used to search Gowalla
		and 4Square for pizzerias in your vicinity.</p>
